  abstract={In recent years, data centers play an important role in academia and industry for supporting various services and applications. Compared with other {IP} networks, data center networks have some special features such as many-to-one communication pattern with high bandwidth, low latency, auto-scaling, shallow buffered switches and multi-rooted tree topology. Owing to these special features of data center networks, traditional {TCP} suffers from severe performance degradation. For improving the performance of {TCP} in data center networks, various solutions have been proposed in recent years. This article presents a comprehensive survey of existing transport layer solutions proposed for mitigating the problems of {TCP} in data center networks. The objective of this article is threefold: to discuss about the issues of {TCP} in data center networks; to introduce various transport layer solutions and finally to compare and discuss the challenges of existing solutions proposed for improving the performance of {TCP} in data center networks.},

  journal={Int J Commun Syst},
  year={2014},
  abstract={In high bandwidth, low latency data center networks, when multiple data senders simultaneously communicate with a single receiver, namely in many-to-one communication pattern, the burst data overload the receiver's switch buffers, which leads to Transmission Control Protocol {(TCP)} throughput collapse. This is the so-called {TCP} Incast problem. It has become a new hot research topic in recent years. Also, many proposals have been put forward from the aspects of multiple layers including link layer, transport layer, and application layer, etc., to mitigate {TCP} Incast. In this paper, an in-depth survey on these proposals is given, and the principles, merits, and drawbacks of the main proposals for solving the {TCP} Incast issue are analyzed and summarized.
